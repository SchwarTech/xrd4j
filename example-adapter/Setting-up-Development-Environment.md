This document describes how a developer's workstation can be setup.

### Software Requirements

* Linux or Windows
* Java 7
* Tomcat 6 or 7 or 8
* Maven 3.x

### Getting the code

The example adapter project is a part of the XRd4J git repository. You can access the source code by cloning it:

```
git clone https://github.com/nordic-institute/xrd4j.git
```

The example adapter is a separate Maven project and can be found under the `example-adapter` directory.

### Building the code

Example adapter uses Maven as the build management tool. In order to build the whole project and generate the WAR-file (`example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.war`), you must run the maven command below from the project root directory.

```
mvn clean install
```

Running the above maven command generates the WAR-file under the directory presented below (`x.x.x` being replaced by the version):

```
target/example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.war
```

#### Error on building the code

If running `mvn clean install` generates the error 

```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project example-adapter: Could not resolve dependencies for project com.pkrete.xrd4j.tools:example-adapter:war:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies at com.pkrete.xrd4j:common:jar:0.0.1: Failed to read artifact descriptor for com.pkrete.xrd4j:common:jar:0.0.1: Could not transfer artifact com.pkrete.xrd4j:common:pom:0.0.1 from/to NIIS-repo (https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-releases): sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target -> [Help 1]
```

try one of two solutions:

##### Solution 1

Skip certificate validation:

```
mvn install -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.insecure=true -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.allowall=true
```

##### Solution 2

Import NIIS's Maven repository's certificate as a trusted certificate into `cacerts` keystore. See full [instructions](../documentation/Import-a-Certificate-as-a-Trusted-Certificate.md). NIIS Maven repository's URL is  `https://artifactory.niis.org`.

### IDE Setup

The project can be imported into different IDEs, but currently this section covers only Netbeans. Some modifications are required regardless of the IDE that's being used.

#### Netbeans

Opening the project in Netbeans.

* File -> Open Project -> path of the project folder -> Click Open Project button

Adding a new Tomcat server.

* Tools -> Servers -> Add Server

### Running the application

Below there's the default URL of the application. 

[http://localhost:8080/example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT/Endpoint](http://localhost:8080/example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT/Endpoint)

**N.B.!** If `example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.war` file is manually copied in Tomcat's webapp folder, then the application can be accessed at:

[http://localhost:8080/example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT/Endpoint](http://localhost:8080/example-adapter-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT/Endpoint)
